I'm a comparative physiologist, broadly interested in how temperature and ecology affect the physiology and mechanics of animal movement. 

The Rummel Lab is opening at Rice University this summer. I am recruiting Ph.D. students to begin in Rice's EEB program in fall of 2024. If you are interested, please email me!

I'm a comparative physiologist, broadly interested in the physiology and mechanics of animal movement, particularly how they respond over various timescales to thermal and other environmental variation. [CV updated January 2024.](/files/Rummel_CV_jan2024.pdf)

Alexandria has a background in thoracic oncology nursing and applies her foundation in anatomy and physiology to the study of bats. Alexandria is interested in investigating adaptations to physiologically demanding environments and behaviors such as migratory flight. More specifically, she is eager to apply this interest to urban bat populations and explore the metabolic adaptations and phenotypic plasticity that induce some bats to overwinter in Houston while others migrate south to Mexico.

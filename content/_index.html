<p>I’m a comparative physiologist, broadly interested in the physiology and mechanics of animal movement, particularly how they respond over various timescales to thermal and other environmental variation.</p>
<p><strong>The Rummel Lab is opening at Rice University this summer</strong> and I am recruiting Ph.D. students to begin in Rice’s <a href="https://biosciences.rice.edu/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology-graduate-program">EEB program</a> in fall of 2024. If you are interested in applying this fall, please email me!</p>

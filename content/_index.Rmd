I'm a comparative physiologist, broadly interested in the physiology and mechanics of animal movement, particularly how they respond over various timescales to thermal and other environmental variation. 

**The Rummel Lab is opening at Rice University this summer** and I am recruiting Ph.D. students to begin in Rice's [EEB program](https://biosciences.rice.edu/ecology-and-evolutionary-biology-graduate-program) in fall of 2024. If you are interested in applying this fall, please email me!

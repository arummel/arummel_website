CV updated January 2024.\n\n Alexandria Shockney  Ph.D. Student\nAlexandria has a background in thoracic oncology nursing and applies her foundation in anatomy and physiology to the study of bats. Alexandria is interested in investigating adaptations to physiologically demanding environments and behaviors such as migratory flight. More specifically, she is eager to apply this interest to urban bat populations and explore the metabolic adaptations and phenotypic plasticity that induce some bats to overwinter in Houston while others migrate south to Mexico.\n\n Kate Manges Douglas  Ph.D. Student\nKate has a background in evolutionary biology with a focus on sexual selection/conflict, specifically on the function of the baculum. She is interested in exploring differential thermoregulatory strategies, especially torpor, among natural and urban populations of bats. Kate is also interested in studying the mechanics of flight and its associated structures, like the sensory hairs found on wings.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/team/","section":"Team","summary":"Andrea Rummel, Principle Investigator  I’m a comparative physiologist, broadly interested in the physiology and mechanics of animal movement, particularly how they respond over various timescales to thermal and other environmental variation.","title":"Team"}]
